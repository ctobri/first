<h1>Canada Goose (Prod. BricksDaMane)</h1>
<p>[Intro]
Uh, uh, na-na-naa
Uh, uh, na-na-naa
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (fur, burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done f***ed up and got me in a cruiser (bla, bla, bla)
Mercedes-Benz coupe, ring a ice cube (Benz coupe, ice cube)
Live my life so fast, ain't telling what I might do (might do)
He want smoke blow, 45 coke (bla, bla)
It's a ISO, ayy I'm Michael (bla, Jordan)
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1]
I talk a lot of s**t 'cause I could back it (up)
Got my d**k in her throat watch her back it (suck)
I'm all about my bread like a fat kid
I'm all about my swag like its fashion
And I'm super savage, grew up as the bad kid (bad kid)
My n****s on your block, call it camping (camping)
They don't want no static (nah, nah, nah, nah)
Pull up let em have it (bow, bow, bow, bow)
Killers in the first-degree (first-degree)
Uh, a lot of n****s wanna murder me (murder me)
Ayy, so I got a glizzy (ayy, ayy)
Turn him over like he Timothy (Turner)
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (fur, burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done f***ed up and got me in a cruiser (bla, bla, bla)
Mercedes-Benz coupe, ring a ice cube (Benz coupe, ice cube)
Live my life so fast, ain't telling what I might do (might do)
He want smoke blow, 45 coupe (bla, bla)
It's a ISO, ayy I'm Michael (bla, Jordan)
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2]
I give it all up, to see my man back
I brought a mobster, to see my opps dead
I see the same fed, I knew I clocked it
Studio trappin', just for content
'Cause I don't know what they have at the border (border)
All this good mixin' bad, feelin' bipolar (bipolar)
If the feds on my tail, I start to floor her (boom)
Big chain on my belly, f*** a chocker (f*** a chocker)
Came up off of home raids, Chucky sleeping over
Friday boomin' but Sunday's little slower (slower)
Trappin' was a hobby, Honda was the car key (trap)
Ayy, hunnid for this Monclees
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (fur, burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done f***ed up and got me in a cruiser (bla, bla, bla)
Mercedes-Benz coupe, ring a ice cube (Benz coupe, ice cube)
Live my life so fast, ain't telling what I might do (might do)
He want smoke blow, 45 coupe (bla, bla)
It's a ISO, ayy I'm Michael (bla, Jordan)
<br><br><br>
[Outro]
Big chain on my belly, f*** a chocker
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</p>

<h1>Authentic (Prod. BricksDaMane)</h1>
<p>[Hook] (2x)
They ain't authentic, they ain't authentic
I'm the type to die for my homies take lessons
n****s move like b***hes, b***hes moving different
n****s in the trap, for a day they not consistent
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1]
They not consistent, n****s sittin' on work
And if that n**** itchin' then i shoot first
Clip in my ruger, clip look like a ruler
I could teach a lil' n**** lesson like a tutor
I just paid 1500 for this new shirt
T-Shirt Givenchy, Pressa Armani
So much on my shoulders, I feel like Hova
Bullets stretch a f*** n**** no yoga
Diamonds look like ace age, im in a iceberg
Designer winter coat, it got fox fur
Just remember, they say we members
They raided us in June and December
Trap smoke, gun smoke, yeah whatever
This is all I know I don't no better
Gucci, gucci, gucci sweater
Tell me who realer, your shoes they not leather
<br><br><br>
[Hook] (2x)
They ain't authentic, they ain't authentic
I'm the type to die for my homies take lessons
n****s move like b***hes, b***hes moving different
n****s in the trap, for a day they not consistent
<br><br><br>
[Bridge]
I'm the type, I'm the type, I'm the type
To die for my homies
I chip a brick like Karate
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2]
Ali, Holy, suddenly top bodies
He a dead man walking like a zombie
Gucci, Fendi, and my shoes are Bally
Ran him down my boots are Bally
Saucy, swaggy, oops I mean I'm Wassi
Wassi fell like Larry, I fell like Wassi
Ooh-ah, that fif' kickin' like Fifa
Smoke a n**** like some shisha
Meanwhile, the news say I'm a leader
Smoke him like sativas, diamonds like arenas
n****s they gone freeze up, they hands numb
How n****s poppin' bottles and they mans gone?
<br><br><br>
[Hook] (2x)
They ain't authentic, they ain't authentic
I'm the type to die for my homies take lessons
n****s move like b***hes, b***hes moving different
n****s in the trap, for a day they not consistent
<br><br><br>
[Bridge]
I'm the type, I'm the type, I'm the type
To die for my homies
I chip a brick like Karate</p>

[Hook]
I say, I say she so pretty
I say, I say she so pretty, she so pretty
She know she don't need no make up, them girls is filthy
Right now she drive a beamer, she need a rarri
And I swear i need the baddest, in the party

Right now she drive a beamer, she need a rarri
And i swear I need the baddest, in the party
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1]
I don't, I don't wanna fall in love, with strippers
Cuz I don't wanna f*** up, and save her
I just want alot of fast cars, and acres
And she just want a lot of clothes, and favors
She, she won't slay a n****, like Zelda
She a lil baddy, Griselda
I was eating lobster, on Helsha
And we can go to Vegas or somewhere elsewhere
But I'm done with this life, they gon' need a monument
Why you hoping that I lose when I'm out here tryna' win
Everytime I break it down you gon' tell me something diff
She always arguing i'm not into arguments
I like life on the concrete but somehow to fly a Rolls
You ain't even worth enough to me to buy a watch or Rose
And I just wanted my daughter to be like my Aunty Rose
And I keep telling Rosy just to leave the streets alone
Baby would you go to jail for me I'm talkin' federal
They hate that i'm successful, they wan't me shackled
And if we on a boat, would you help me paddle?
If I went away today would you miss my shadow
She just wan't the telly, no day shift
She just want more nail polish more foundation
And I don't need a girl to get me money I get hell of it
I just need a natural girl that's crazy for the kid
<br><br><br>
[Hook]
I say, I say she so pretty
She so pretty
She know she don't need no make up, them girls is filthy
Right now she drive a beamer, she need a rarri
And I swear i need the baddest, in the party
I say, I say she so pretty
She so pretty
She know she don't need no make up, them girls is filthy
Right now she drive a beamer, she need a rarri
And I swear I need the baddest, in the party
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2]
Told her she don't need a filter she say i kill her
She don't question bout the price she don't ask a the tailor
And I don't care what em girls cuz this one realer
And every everytime I'm in her, I'm in her liver
And she like to show me off cuz she know I'm popular
Now everytime we in the mall, she says take my palm
She say I'm her trophy, she considers she won
She said she need a baby girl, but I need a son
She, she know that I'm Pressa, don't need to impress her
They ain't in my league please go tell them boys to catch up
My life was on the line cuz every time I stepped up
And I can't chase a broad cuz that's how my money raised up
She say that i'm handsome, that I got a lot
Told her yeah i'm from the block she said I don't look from the block
I just want you for the night, I don't want you past dawn
And shorty ain't forever, shorty on the clock
Yo baby got no swag I think she need a stylist
And I make em so bad, shorty look ridiculous
Got me on a drunk night, how did i wake up to this?
And I ain't even thirsty, but last night yeah I must've been
She ain't into cuddling, she wozzling
And the way she down my loads in, she buffering
And the way I'm dancing in it, I'm shuffling
And the way I beat that pussy up, i'm fussling
<br><br><br>
[Hook]
I say, I say she so pretty
She so pretty
She know she don't need no make up, them girls is filthy
Right now she drive a bimmer, she need a rarri
And i swear i need the baddest, in the party
I say, I say she so pretty
She so pretty
She know she don't need no make up, them girls is filthy
Right now she drive a bimmer, she need a rarri
And i swear i need the baddest, in the party</p>

<h1>420 in London (Prod. Murda Beatz)</h1>
<p>[Intro: Pressa]
Murda, Murda, Murda s**t
Ayy
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: Pressa]
420 up in London
I'm a problem, call the ombudsman (hello?)
Me and Murda, we up to somethin'
I was on the hound and almost caught me in Fort Nelson
Mr. Hustle hard, now they claimin' they my cousin
I f*** your b***h, now she thinkin' I'm her husband
I'm in some Balmains, these jeans cost a dozen
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'(ice)
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1: Pressa]
Remember days when I was on the run
Couldn't leave my house without a gun
Told Mama wouldn't make them take your son
I moved her out the hood now a n**** shoot for fun (let's get it)
f*** a friend I just do this for my loved ones
We came far from sleeping in the dungeon
Air contamination I ain't breath right since hustlin'
Started off with coins now I'm run-in' up the hundreds
Mama found my strap in my room while she cussin'
Neighbor was a traphouse cuz' I had it pumpin'
Plottin' on the mansion
Views by the sunset
Cookin' up my dinner
Never ate my lunch yet
Pressa got you mad, huh?
30 clip mad long
Chip it till' the pack gone
Business was my thing
Gotta keep a structure
Shots up to Taurus
His lungs were punctured
Diamonds were my first name
Jewellery part of culture
Ran out of minutes
Think I need a voucher
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I was on the molly, b***hes out in Boston
f***ed the b***h in Follies, her pussy was awesome
Rockstar life Jeff Hardy, do tricks like Mat Hoffman
She just wanna party, she do that s**t often
She gon' suck my d**k until she start gaggin' and coughin'
Am I scared? No, hardly, I deserve a heart lift
My new crib, it's so big, this s**t got a office
I was off a thirty, this s**t made me nauseous
My new car on derbies, automatic parking
Ballin' in my jersey, in the streets I'm Jordan
12 checked me, then they took my gun
Me, no trippin' 'cause I got a whole 'nother gun
If she leave me, yeah I've got a whole 'nother one
I put that on my son and I ain't even got a son
Red green, beam green, b***h I never miss
She sucked the lines up out my d**k like it's a peppermint
I get the cheese, like I work for the government
I'm an alien lookin' for your mother ship
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: Lil Uzi Vert]
420 up in London
I'm a problem, God, yeah, I'll bust 'em (on god)
Me and Murda, we up to somethin'
I was on the the hound they almost caught me at Fort Nelson
Mr. Hustle hard, now they claimin' they're my cousin (my cousin)
I f*** your b***h, now she thinkin' I'm her husband
I'm in some Balmains, these jeans they cost a dozen (12)
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin' (uh)
<br><br><br>
[Outro: Lil Uzi Vert]
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
I'm iced out, this Rollie cost me nothin'
Yeah!</p>
