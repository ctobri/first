<h1>Str8 Out The Pyrex (Prod. Pyrex Whippa)</h1>
<p>[Intro]
Zone 6 n****, Pyrex Whippa
Pyre
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Yea
Straight out the Pyrex, but this money is making me cocky
Rocking Versace shades with my haters they block them
Ride through my hood bring on I drive through this topless
Silent for life never talked to no coppers
Charge me like rapper watch out how fast I pop him
Said "f**k the rollie" went bought some choppas
No I didn't f**k her she just gave me top
When I talk about money they switch up the topic
Count up this fifty I don't smoke on no broccoli
Lil hoe she petty I f**ked then I blocked her
Pints of the lean like I f**k with the Doctor
We get the choppa now awesome we drop him
Can't go out like whatchamacallit
Aim at yo face you did Glock like Chris Paul
Bro got a iPhone lock behind walls
<br><br><br>
[Verse]
He show a shank every time he call
He said is knifeless blood on the wall
They gave him life
He said his b***h ain't even send out a kite
Says whole click chain they ain't rocking with right
Never thought I would get rich off mic
5 racks on my fit and I don't wear it twice
I still pull in my hood shoe dice
b***h I'm a boss and it came with a price
The ones that you love be the one turn shyest
Please don't play in this club cause my young n**** psychic
We got a**ault riffles, yea
Fire your s**t like a lighter
They tryna ride on my wave tighter
Pop me a perc' I get higher
Straight out the dirt had to make momma prouder
Now my whole family got dollars
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Yea
Straight out the Pyrex, but this money is making me cocky
Rocking Versace shades with my haters they block them
Ride through my hood bring on I drive through this topless
Silent for life never talked to no coppers
Charge me like rapper watch out how fast I pop him
Said "f**k the rollie" went bought some choppas
No I didn't f**k her she just gave me top
When I talk money they switch up the topic
Count up this fifty I don't smoke on no broccoli
Lil hoe she petty I f**ked then I blocked her
Pints of the lean like I f**k with the Doctor
We get the choppa now awesome we drop him
Can't go out like whatchamacallit
Aim at yo face you did Glock like Chris Paul
Bro got a iPhone lock behind walls</p>

<h1>100 Missed Calls (Prod.LosTheProducer, JW Lucas & Pyrex)</h1>
<p>[Chorus]
When I woke up I had 100 missed calls, text, message

Neck full of diamonds

Have you ever seen a hundred thou-blue hunid Bill's (huh?)
They say I'm Hollywood, I'm in the hills
Got 4g auto all on my whip (s**t)

Got my own Guwap I ain't ask you for s**t (rack)

When I get bored then I might (?) hit
Rocking Dior got your b***h on my d**k
Drip, and my wrist got a whole brick
Hop in a foreign do tricks
Look at this s**t

Spending this money I'm dizzy
Switching my cars and all on (?)
Last night I flew to Philly

Ain't to many I can trust I let these rubber bands bust

Think this s**t be sweet you crossed the line you know theirs repercussion
Come from the mud
Now my condos view the whole city
Don't need no washing dryer f**k it add another stove

They know we keep it silent and they know we handle whole business

We came in cleared their was a hundred racks top
Left out the bank big old bags hurt my back bone
Ain't to many I can trust sometimes I feel like i'm alone

Or probably be serving your auntie
Just might catch me a jet out the country
Neck full of carats and s**t like a bunny

Come on
Gudda Tay on every beat, n****, Gudda
Cook that s**t up, Quay
D. Hill
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm walking through hell
My brother got hit up with shells
We runnin' through bags, the narcs on our a**
But f**k it, nobody gon' tell
Some n****s switched up, oh well
All my n****s bossed up, we player
We going up, need to get this on film
Got my weight up, I didn't go to no gym
The chopper stay tucked, it's gon' knock off some limbs
I want all the smoke, yeah the s**t you inhale
Yeah I could've failed but a n**** prevailed
Got some racks on me now and this s**t it got layers
I smoke out the pound, you gon' weigh on the scale
My packs airborne, they come through the mail
My son is four, he rich as the mayor
My brother locked up and he trap out his cell
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1]
Your girl is a w**re, the gang gon' slay her
Beat down, drill, we'll shoot a hundred shots
Pop this chopper, got 'em ducking like a fire drill
I'm on lean, weed, pills, neck got the f**king chills
Yeah this beat come from Gudda Tay, Quay, and D. Hill
Before I was rapping, yeah a young n**** was trapping
Post in the cut and I get out the package
Her a** and titties is clapping but the s**t plastic
Boy I'm so sick of the capping
Godzilla, got hitters, been platinum
I want some lamb but f**k it I can't go to platinum
They heard that I signed me a deal, they said I'm worth millions
Why the f**k I be on Candler?
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm walking through hell
My brother got hit up with shells
We runnin' through bags, the narcs on our a**
But f**k it, nobody gon' tell
Some n****s switched up, oh well
All my n****s bossed up, we player
We going up, need to get this on film
Got my weight up, I didn't go to no gym
The chopper stay tucked, it's gon' knock off some limbs
I want all the smoke, yeah the s**t you inhale
Yeah I could've failed but a n**** prevailed
Got some racks on me now and this s**t it got layers
I smoke out the pound, you gon' weigh on the scale
My packs airborne, they come through the mail
My son is four, he rich as the mayor
My brother locked up and he trap out his cell
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2]
My brother caught life so he couldn't pay the bail
My son ain't but four, he rich and he player
He watch me record, he watch all my film
He told me take the 1'5 to the gym
So I keep dropping hits, I keep giving hell
The fans goin' up, they jumping the rail
Stay with a shrimp, might pull up and kill
When I need me a temp I pull up with shells
They say I'm dabbing, I'm fresh as hell
I'm rocking Givenchy, my b***h do it well
Balenci, Christian, Gucci, Chanel
Wraith, Bentley camera, riding down Mill
Sliding four fifty-eight like a bat out of hell
Go high speed chase, got 12 on my tail
We got packs and they sell
We got bricks and they frail
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
Feel like I'm walking through hell
My brother got hit up with shells
We runnin' through bags, the narcs on our a**
But f**k it, nobody gon' tell
Some n****s switched up, oh well
All my n****s bossed up, we player
We going up, need to get this on film
