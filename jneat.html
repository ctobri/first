<h1>For My Bros</h1>
<p>[Hook] (x2)
Ima go hard for my bro’s I’ll kill a hunned n****s just to see cro
Stuck in the trenches with poles he turn crazy we’ll wipe his nose
(?), I pop them percs to stay out my feelings
Dissing my dawgs get turned to a victim uh can’t trust him too iffy
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1]
I lost my cro this ain’t feel real, came from the trenches we just tryna see a mill’
Now it just feel like a dream just the other day he was serving the fiends
Now I don’t see no more, lost my trust so my heart turned cold
I keep that heater though, I’m ‘bout my bread like a pizza dough
I know that you fake I can see from the look in your eyes
You reap what sow so you know that death come with life
So I ain’t wasting time don’t be mad if I’m stuck on my grind
I turn that boy to ashes, teach you a lesson lil n**** stop lacking
Ima go hard ima shine, ima pour my pain in all of these rhymes
This 40 stay right by my side mention the guys you don’t wanna die
He ain’t got no loyalty I can see the fake in ‘em
I can see the snake in ‘em, pull up and we blazing ‘em
<br><br><br>
[Hook] (x2)
Ima go hard for my bro’s I’ll kill a hunned n****s just to see cro
Stuck in the trenches with poles he turn crazy we’ll wipe his nose
(?), I pop them percs to stay out my feelings
Dissing my dawgs get turned to a victim uh can’t trust him too iffy
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2]
I’m in the trap, uh, uh, I make it flip again
She wanna f***, uh, uh, I told her bring a friend
Double my cup, uh, uh, I’m drinking medicine
I’m chasing them Borden’s, them Benjamin’s, she talking ‘bout love I ain’t hearing it
Now my heart be vacant, RICO Gang ‘till the world blow
You cannot handle my lifestyle when the game test you please don’t choke
Got demons all in my head, see the devil before I go to bed
My mom praying I ain’t next but I be one step ahead
Ay, ay, ay, ay, so I cannot slip like a skate
My hammer be right on my waist, yeah, white chalk yellow tape
Wet up your block n**** let it rain, he think he hot then we gonna blaze him up
Let his mom see him on the cable yeah, all this pain I’m facing yeah
My young n****s I ain’t controlling ‘em, pull up then they smoking ‘em
I was in a stolen car tryna switch to a foreign
The things that I did you wouldn’t handle it, catch me a opp ima vanish him
But I wasn’t into no magic shooting s**t just became a habit
<br><br><br>
[Hook] (x2)
Ima go hard for my bro’s I’ll kill a hunned n****s just to see cro

She got a big back like Nicki Minaj

She get that bag she can move the rock
Just bring my cash and move along
Drinkin' this Henny till the pain all go
Back to back drills you ain't seen your mom
R.I.P the guys and free the ones locked
Fo'sho we got thirties up at them Glock's
Fo'sho we send thirty up at his top
Investing 'cause I can't take a loss
Trappin' hard, trappin' O's in the pot
<br><br><br>

<h1>Different (Prod. Ayywalker Beats)</h1>
<p>{Chorus}
Different day, new s**t
Compact extended clip
All these hunnids, lovin' it
Instead of sex we get it in
Keep a tool jus like I'm bob
Got a problem than we solve
When my shordies get the drop I send my youngins on that job
<br><br><br>
Different day, new s**t
Compact extended clip
All these hunnids, lovin' it
Instead of sex we get it in
Keep a tool jus like I'm bob
Got a problem than we solve
When my shordies get the drop I send my youngins on that job
<br><br><br>
{Verse 1}
I got the drip, I got the wass
Got 30 shots in that Glock
I chase rackades, I chase opps
What you need, I got it in shops
She give me knowledge, thats smart
My shooters rollin like a cob
If he on his back he won't make it far
I'm up north where we trap hard
Do it 3 times for the mob
I send shordy to get a job
This is a mismatch you can't guard
Im goin' hard like i'm Lebron
(Uh,Uh)
I go hard like i'm Lebron
I re-up then i get it gone
I need bandz if you need a song
(Ay)
I might fly today
She wanna fly wit me
So I told her let's fly away
(Ay,Ay)
And I just need the cake
And she just want some love
But i jus need some face
<br><br><br>
{Chorus}
Different day, new s**t
Compact extended clip

{Verse 2}
Headshots, Lights out
No fronts in my traphouse
Hit a lick and cash out
I be on the cash route
Imma blow her back out
Imma make her tap out
I be in my bag now
I be in my bag now
(Ay)
Keep my hoodie on like A Boogie
Wit a black mask some black gloves and a Bape hoodie
That's a scary sight, you don't wanna lose your life
I have to walk wit a pipe cuz they tryna take my life
Might f*** your b***h for the night then send her back in the mornin'
Gotta answer, fiends be callin'
Back to back when I'm yawnin
But for the money I'm up
Might pour a 4 in a crush
Get rolled up in a blunt
It's a new day i'm still up
<br><br><br>
{Chorus}
Different day, new s**t
Compact extended clip
All these hunnids, lovin' it
Instead of sex we get it in
Keep a tool jus like I'm bob
Got a problem than we solve
When my shordies get the drop I send my youngins on that job
<br><br><br>
Different day, new s**t
Compact extended clip
All these hunnids, lovin' it
Instead of sex we get it in

<h1>DRIP FREESTYLE</h1>
<p>[Intro: WhyS]
You diss Wassi you get shot, in your f***in' head
Two trap phones but bros callin' from the dead
You control your life homie, you make your bed
I got deadmihana dawg, I don't need the meds
My forty is actin' up, I think my b***h on the reds
I'm 'bout to slap it up and lock my hair in the dreads
Gang, gang, gang, gang
You know how we rockin' n****
<br><br><br>
[Verse]
I ran to that bag they be lazy
Different sauce I ain't talkin' 'bout gravy
Quarter breezy's stuck on a baby
I was robbin' the trap, is what saved me
In the field like a n**** playin' football
Got the place still jumpin' like John Wall
I started gettin' money now they pissed off
Watch that dope lock like a pit jaw
My shooters they shoot with precision
We got birds I ain't talkin' about pigeons
Hunned M's is a young n**** mission
And that life that I spit man I live it
Man I just wanna ball like I’m TwoTwo
Big neenr on me not no deuce, deuce
Get knocked man I don't know who's who
Feds tryna solve the case like it's Blue's Clue's
It’s Jneat man I ain't gotta say much
Got my wrist in the pot, got that good touch
If you think that you’re sick, n**** try some
See a face on the news that's that real love
I can never let bygones be bygones
I'm gon' run him down until the clip done
Gotta pray everyday, I be sinnin'
Thank god for all the times he forgiven
I keep a stick 'cause I can't be a victim
Eyes closed 'cause I can't be a witness
'Cause I ain't goin' out and I ain't snitchin'
I'm the man, I’m the man and they know it
Stay humble keep the money growin'
Had to wait, had to wait I was patient
Now I know that my team is gon' make it
And we chasin' that bread like i'm bakin'
Twenty-four in the clip like a Laker
Twenty-four in the clip like a Laker
Said she wanna f*** but I don't save herb
You can have that b***h I don't date her
I don't date her, I don't date her
You can have that b***h I don't date her
I don't date her, I don't date her
You can have that b***h I want paper
I'm chasin' money I want all of it
These n****s praying that I fall and quit
If it's not a bag, what you offerin'?
I don’t want your sex, I get lots of it
Late nights had to grind for this
Couple zips on me, that's a basic trip
My shooter ain't playin', better watch your lip
Can't say too much, n****s talkin' s**t
Streets cold, keep a Glock and s**t
Think he a man he gon' talk and s**t
No ball but i'm nice wit' the rockin' s**t
Name somebody we ain't harder than
I love my life so I walk wit' it
Try to diss the guys then we chalkin' him
f*** the opps and whoever rock wit' 'em
Like Golden State ain't no stoppin' us
When bosses talk better listen
We don't do indirect and sneak disses
Free WhyS, my broksi a menace
YV take his life in some seconds
My name hold weight like i'm benchin'
We them n****s and we came wit' extentions
This that new Wass you can't catch it
He tryna run his mouth 'til we catch him
When that day comes you gon' regret it
'Cause we gon' leave a man at the intersection
Opps like ounto how we press 'em
Free them guys who’s sendin' them letters
f*** the system, can't hold you forever
Stayin' low and stackin' my cheddar
She wanna f*** 'cause her man can't do better
Ran through the scene with the pole under my sweater
Aye, aye, aye
Whip it up, whip it up
Aye, aye, aye
Lil' n**** show me some
Aye, aye, aye
Lil' n**** where you from
Aye, aye, aye
Told lil' bro load it up
In the dot gotta be on kotch
Whole lotta XD's, whole lotta Glock
Try to run up on me, TallUp start sendin' 'em shots
No we don't box, we put n****s on the box
Them Wassers go crazy, wanna see 'em at your top
Wassers go crazy, wanna see 'em at your top
Aye, aye, aye
Wanna see 'em at your top
<br><br><br>
[Outro: Tallup Twinz]
