<h1>Auntie ft. Houdini</h1>
<p>[Chorus: WhyG]
In the trap with your Auntie (Hey, Auntie)
She whip a brick in her panty
It's WhyG and Houdini (Crodie!)
I think she want to get battried
I put a Dubz in my backy (Dubz)
This glizzy kick like Messi
I leave the scene so messy
I got a wozzle from her and her bestie (Wozzle)
In the trap with your Auntie (Hey, Auntie)
She whip a brick in her panty
It's WhyG and Houdini (Crodie!)
I think she want to get battried
I put a Dubz in my backy (Dubz)
This glizzy kick like Messi
I leave the scene so messy
I got a wozzle from her and her bestie (Wozzle)
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1: WhyG]
My b***h she ball, Lisa Leslie
Fifty cal dance, a dezzie (Dezzie)
I'm in VLONE Amiri (Dripping)
Bad b***h she listen to me like she Siri
Keep a big glizzy if you try to get near me
Mr.VanishYa and my opps fear me
I got a trap house all the way Surrey
I got a red dot, looks like a Cherry
This isn't a regular blackberry
Dunk on a n**** like I'm Charles Barkeley
Deadmihana this not broccoli (Demi)
I got a fall for my car key (Whip)
Louis V stamp on her birdy (Birdy)
She gives me brain, she so nerdy (wozzle)
She swallows me like she Kirby
Her mouth was clean but I left it dirty (wozzle)
Wassi felt like Larry
I feel like Wassi, run a n**** up
Let's start a possy
I'm so dripy, I'm so saucy
She was tweakin', off a molly
Transformed my d**k to a lolly
Police want me, I was in Holly
Dealt with me like it was a ah-ee
WhyG, all of the pollys
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: WhyG]
In the trap with your Auntie (Hey, Auntie)
She whip a brick in her panty
It's WhyG and Houdini (Crodie!)
I think she want to get battried
I put a Dubz in my backy (Dubz)
This glizzy kick like Messi
I leave the scene so messy
I got a wozzle from her and her bestie (Wozzle)
In the trap with your Auntie
She whip up a brick in her pantie
It's WhyG and Houdini
I think she want to get battried
I put a Dubz in my backy
This glizzy kick like Messi
I leave the scene so messy
I got a wozzle from her and her bestie
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2: Houdini]
Glock it kick like Jet Li (Glock)
I'm in the trap with a .9 and a baby (Trap)
Been reuping on a daily (Being up)
We serving food like this s**t was the 80
Remember them days, your auntie said save me
I'm in the raid with a .380
Bro spin the block, in a Mercedes
You just a actor, you playing crazy
All of this money I'm making is lazy
Pot foaming up, like it got rabies
All of these bids this s**t like the Navy
We in L.A somewhere where the stars be
Sippin' some red in the booth with Shy Glizzy
Hop on a hound, I do me a [?]
I took a flight landed in BC
Valentino with a Moncleez
Got a little bit of Gucci
Studio trapping with WhyG (WhyG)
Dripping, dripping like a hypebeast (Hypebeast)
Wassa’s don’t need me a army (Nah)
I got the sound like Parri (Parri)
White girls say I'm gnarly (Gnarly)
You know I lock off the party (Lock)
I think I need me a Cardi (Cardi)
<br><br><br>
[Chorus]
In the trap with your Auntie (Hey, Auntie)
She whip a brick in her panty
It's WhyG and Houdini (Crodie!)
I think she want to get battried
I put a Dubz in my backy (Dubz)
This glizzy kick like Messi
I leave the scene so messy
I got a wozzle from her and her bestie (Wozzle)
In the trap with your Auntie (Hey, Auntie)
She whip a brick in her panty
It's WhyG and Houdini (Crodie!)
I think she want to get battried
I put a Dubz in my backy (Dubz)
This glizzy kick like Messi
I leave the scene so messy
I got a wozzle from her and her bestie (wozzle)</p>

<h1>Wlatt Season 2 (Prod. Zach808)</h1>
<p>[WHY-G]
Designer drip, I mixed with nikes
Designer drugs, I mix the sprite
I mix the fentanyl so nice
Rickey rackades i spent on the ice
Nintendo switch with a flash light
All of my opps are to the side
Plus my aim is so precise
I guarantee you won't survive
Drop it up on 'em like surprise
And a black mask, for disguise
I left his head hard to describe
I made his head and his neck divide
Ambulance cannot revive
We kill s**t like genocide
He want smoke, that's suicide
b***h I'm big boss 35
<br><br><br>
[SupaWassi]
When we drift, we pause the time
I put a bag on top of your life
I got rich off of doing crime
White b***h nosy, she do lines
Don't wipe your nose, b***h, you ain't slime
That thirty roarin' like a lion
Smoked for his watch, he ran outta time
Headshot make your face recline
Beef with us? That's suicide
Shoot your school up, Columbine
I was the last thing he memorized
We cook beef and let it fry
Ball up spikey, porcupine
<br><br><br>
[WHY-G]
Burrrrrrrrrr!
And i'm big wlatt
And i'm big slime
I only fuck b***hes from behind
I creep up on ya', take my time
Witnesses say they traumatized
If he ain't dead, he paralyzed
I stretch a brick like exercise
She give me head, I hypnotize
Big glizzy it's customized
Red Tony runners, it's over sized
Vanish ya', you're vaporized
And my trap house organized
We got up and down the side
My opp block get terrorized
I see a opp and he neutralize
Kill a n**** ain't tat my eyes
Wass gang what I advertise
Thanos with this .45
Wet him like he got baptized
<br><br><br>
[SupaWassi]
If I get caught []
We take ya' soul, you sacrifice
We take you out, you penalized
Wassas creepin' like your priors
My opps get busy, pass me the fire
Sellin' white girl, Lizzy McGuire
Trap house feelin' like the wire
Clip got hang time like Vince Carter
We ain't last when it's darker
Throwin' bullets like the chargers
Screw with my pup, you'd get murdered
Look at the script, Timmy Turner
Snatch her soul she just like a burglar
You ride my wave, you ain't a surfer
Glizzy touch you like a diddler
It made a b***h, you ain't a killer
<br><br><br>
[WHY-G]
[] but he at Winners
Blaze 'em up like Damien Lilard
Vanish 'em just like a wizard
Had to drop him like some liter
Wipe ya' nose, i'm a real killer
I'm a big dog just like i'm clifford
n****s bugs like catapillars
Think he sick? I'm sicker
I kill 'em, shots like liquor
Go switch for [] quicker
I'm a swisher, not a bricker
I'm in her mouth like Snickers
Me and cro, not a wicker
Real shooter derek fisher
Two two glizzy's they sisters
My trigger fingers, it got blisters</p>

<h1>NeatMachine II ft. Pressa</h1>
<p>[Verse 1: WHY-G]
I think I popped two percs (percies)
But i'm still alert (i am)
Walk on your block and I lurk (lurk)
Red beam, I need a green latern (green)
Headshot, then I send you Satern (lah)
I find a bridge then I burn (burn)
I shoot this glizzy like Steve Kerr
This glizzy burn your hair like a perm
I'm off a perc so I talk with a slur
I'm thinkin' 36 mafia sippin' sizzurp
Walk up with a glizzy then I burst
Pop out the cut like a burp
I'm in the trap with the birds
I'm in the trap with my youngins 'cause they gotta learn
Bad b***h she sucked my d**k said she from Malvern
Make the dope come back like a U-turn
Take a bad boy but he just a gerb
Turn an opp to a herb pack
Turn an opp to a pack
93.5 and still can't lack
I be subliminal dissing the opps in my rap
Your gang should be called new era ya' cap
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2: Pressa]
They call me press machine
I put gas in it E
He remind me of a diffy
I make him drop to his knees
Head, head, head, head, head, headshot
I'm from the block, we shot a cop
I smokin' demi, it make me hot
It make me hot
I put the G in the Glock
And I put the B in the block
And I put the C in the clock
Work, work, work, work, work
I put a snake in the box
Lions and tigers and bears
I ain't a typical n****
My n****s trip off a trip
And a n**** said Jane's a jigga
A n**** said Jane's a jigga
I sit on lil n****s like Simba
Nineteen-eleven is kimber
I'm sauce i'm wauce
I'm gang, i'ma lost
I still sing like frost
And she do lines like floss
Trap line never off
There's lines I never cross</p>

They say that my life a gamble (uh)
Cartier lookin' like a bangle (ohh)
Travis Scott wit' his antidote
I stay wit' the cord like umbilicle
My life a movie like paid in full
2-2-3 we ain't playin' zone
I barely could play wit' four
We rollin' dice till morn'
Money make plays we rule (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Bad lil' b***h she get around
Drip too hard, she almost drowned
Whole new story watch 'em now
Newspaper article runnin' around
We run him down
He tryna to ball but his ball barely bounce
A lil' 10k barely a camp
We gettin' money look at me now
I need a nip, I need it now
I did it right, I fit da mic
I did a year, he did a night
He did the dash, he dead tonight
Murda gang, thirty my bra
Runnin' on green fill up the pot
If he ain't got cash, bring out the mac
We had to get it remember them nights
Stuck on a stove
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: WhyG] (x2)
Trap out the bando
Trap out the rental
I'm in the trap, I give out a sample

They say that my life a gamble (uh)

My trap house at the tipoff (trap)
I'm in the trap servin' Chris Rock (chris)
One toke is takin' his lip off
I'm at the stove when i'm whippin' up two pots (skrtt)
All of this ice, it made the dope lock (ice)
All of this ice (ice), I need like two Glocks (ice)
It look like lice (ice), all on her headtop (lice)
She suckin' nice, she gotta good mouth
Roaches and mice all in my trap spot
I turn a court house into my stash house (racks)
I had to bring all the racks out
All these racks made the judge pass out
Walked out da box, supa saucey
Police, they mad that they lost me
I do not even care what it cost me
I know that they mad that they caught me
If he was me, he woulda got ahh ee'd
This is Gucci, this ain't no Tommy
I was in trap house wit' Tommy
50 round drum on the Tommy
This is Raf Simmons
This is a connie
Trap out that buildin'
Trap out the lobby
I beat the case like i'm John Gotti
Shootin' the face if you want a body
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: WhyG] (x2)
Trap out the bando
Trap out the rental
I'm in the trap, I give out a sample
Couldn't play ball, still I got handles

They tried to frame me, it was a scandal (uh)
They say that my life a gamble (uh)</p>
