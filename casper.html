<h1>Freeze ft. Top 5 (Prod. Harmonic Hits)</h1>
<p>[Chorus: Casper]
Freeze
All I ever wanted was to freeze
Cold killers around me, heart freeze
All this ice, drippin' wet, I made her freeze
Police tried to stop me, told me freeze
I just dash, got a big stick on me
Want that s**t, I take that s**t, that n**** freeze
All this ice, drippin' wet, I make her freeze
Snappin' pics, of the kid, I had to freeze
<br><br><br>
[Verse 1: Casper]
That b***h said she love me, I just told her breeze
She love gang sticks and 'caine, I could f**k with ease
She a h*e, she a h*e, I think it's a disease
Plus my opps dying like they block had a disease
Big semi-automatic in my jeans
Big bag full of rocks all for my fiends
Chocolate b***h before I eat, I eat my greens
Elizabeth, for you know that she was never my queen
Big stick on my hip it made me lean
Hit him in the back I made that n**** lean
Pinky ring flooded with them V's
VS on my pendant and my ring
She was not a wifey, she was just a f**k ting
Showed her guns and drugs, and I won't lie, now she corrupted
It's my crazy life but I won't lie, she love it
Will I go to jail tomorrow? Guess I'll keep on wondering
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: Casper]
Freeze
All I ever wanted was to freeze
Cold killers around me, heart freeze
All this ice drippin' wet, I made her freeze
Police tried to stop me, told me freeze
I just dash, got a big stick on me
Want that s**t, I take that s**t, that n**** freeze
All this ice drippin' wet, I make her freeze
Snappin' pics of the kid, I had to freeze
<br><br><br>
[Verse 2: Top 5]
Anis got a 40, make that n**** freeze
Have you ever seen some shooters 103
We be on your block 10 minutes then we leave
You said you're on the Varna, b***h I'm overseas
So much ice, call me 5 Gretzky
Slidin' on your block, Casper got the beam
They can't hold me down if they triple team
Big bands in my pocket made me lean
b***h you know I'm out here
Please don't come around here
If you circle my block you gon' stay right here
We your block's nightmare
Pull up and they all stare
Porsches and them Lams here
Make them all just-
<br><br><br>
[Chorus: Casper]
Freeze
All I ever wanted was to freeze
Cold killers around me, heart freeze
All this ice drippin' wet, I made her freeze
Police tried to stop me, told me freeze
I just dash, got a big stick on me
Want that s**t, I take that s**t, that n**** freeze
All this ice drippin' wet, I make her freeze
Snappin' pics of the kid, I had to freeze</p>

[Verse 1: K Money]
And baby girl I wanna know the reason
Everytime you see me with my money you be preeing
We was turning up and you seen it
So you started f**king with the gang on the weekend
Where your a** was at?
We was teaming
I was dropping stacks on a strap just to squeeze it
Making money blow it for no reason
f**king with M.G., you gonna need Jesus
I'm in it for the money and I mean it
Stop f**king with me right now I can call you if I need it
She wanna link up with me on the weekends
Just because we turn up b***h you acting like you fiending
Where your a** was at, prob'ly sleeping
I was sinnin' winnin' daydreamin'
f**king with my thot, took a drop, I was leanin'
Tryna turn a G to a P for that green, man
<br><br><br>
[Hook: Casper TNG]

[Verse 2: RK]
Shawtie I already know the reason
You just wanna hang cause the Woods steady peeling
Hope these n****s know its murder season
Sippin' on the lean got me feeling like a demon
I just need that green I need a million
I'm in the trap house stacking money to the ceiling
Pull up on your block I'm'a squeeze it
Now a n**** down on the ground blood leaking
Turn a trap house to a motherf**king lean house
Now b***hes asking Casper to bring the lean out
He was talking out till I wheeled up
Then me and KM hop in the whip and peeled out
All my n****s real you should know that
Got the strap, cock it back, you know I'm'a blow that
Run up on us get your witt clapped
n****s want my head, so a n**** gotta stay strapped
<br><br><br>
[Hook: Casper TNG]

All my n****s stay with me, no entourage
I'm just saying run up on me SDot gon' pop it off
Rock paper scissors, I got all 3 what you want
Henny in my liver 'cause I'm spending on alcohol

And she want me cause the cars and I'm iced out
If I draw clap off then it's lights out
And I be smellin' like a backwoods right now
